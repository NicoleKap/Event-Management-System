A team project was deployed during the 'Get Trained and Get Hired' program. 
It is a back-end system designed for managing events organized by the Thessaloniki Municipality. 
The project provided us with the opportunity to collaborate effectively towards a common goal. 
We developed problem-solving, critical thinking, teamwork, and time management skills.
